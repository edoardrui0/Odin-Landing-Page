# Odin-Landing-Page

Hi there! Welcome to my Landing Page project for The Odin Project.

For this project, I hope to bring in together everything I have learned in these past two weeks about HTML and CSS. 
Flexbox has always been my biggest issue, so hopefully now with TOP's help I can smoothly pass this.

FOr this project, I will create a landing page for a business that I have. The business is an HVAC company based out of Tampa, FL.
Although I have this business, my ultimate goal is to eventually become an SWE and leave the trades behind. 

Enjoy my process!
