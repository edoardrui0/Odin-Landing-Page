# Odin-Landing-Page

1/22/2024
Hi there! Welcome to my Landing Page project for The Odin Project.

For this project, I hope to bring in together everything I have learned in these past two weeks about HTML and CSS. 
Flexbox has always been my biggest issue, so hopefully now with TOP's help I can smoothly pass this.

FOr this project, I will create a landing page for a business that I have. The business is an HVAC company based out of Tampa, FL.
Although I have this business, my ultimate goal is to eventually become an SWE and leave the trades behind. 

Enjoy my process!

Hello there! I have completed my landing page project for The Odin Project.

I've learned quite a few things, including border-radius and the concept of clean code. 
This README update is also part of a fix I have to do since i forgot to have index.html part of the base files rather than in a folder.
Once I mv index.html out of the HTML folder, everything broke, and upon trying to fix it, i broke it even move

However, the site should be up and running now. What i did wrong was have the stylesheet be linked as follows
href="/css/...."

The correct way was without that first slash. Something I need to keep in mind for future projects. 

Anyways, I hope you enjoy reading my spaghetti code. I tried my hardest to keep it as clean as possible :p
